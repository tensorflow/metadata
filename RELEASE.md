# Version 0.26.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Added new fields to NaturalLanguageDomain message in the schema, including
    support for specifying vocabularies, constriants on sequence values
    (SequenceValueConstraints), constraints on vocabulary coverage
    (FeatureCoverageConstraints), and constraints on token location
    (location_constraints_regex).

# Version 0.25.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Added new Anomaly and Schema field to support drift and distribution skew
    detection for numeric features.
*   Added a new field in Anomalies proto to report the raw measurements of
    distribution skew detection.
*   From this release TFMD will also be hosting nightly packages on
    https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org. To install the nightly package use the
    following command:

    ```
    pip install -i https://pypi-nightly.tensorflow.org/simple tensorflow-metadata
    ```

    Note: These nightly packages are unstable and breakages are likely to
    happen. The fix could often take a week or more depending on the complexity
    involved for the wheels to be available on the PyPI cloud service. You can
    always use the stable version of TFMD available on PyPI by running the
    command `pip install tensorflow-metadata` .

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

*   Added new Anomaly type to describe when a domain is incompatible with the
    data type.
*   Added new Anomaly types for invalid schema configurations (missing name,
    missing type, etc).
*   Added new Anomaly type to describe when type does not match the data.
*   Added new LifecycleStage:DISABLED.

    install` (needs Bazel).
*   Labels can be specified as Paths in addition to string names.
*   Depends on `absl-py>=0.9,<0.11`.
*   Depends on `googleapis-common-protos>=1.52.0,<2`.

*   Added new Anomaly type to describe data that has unexpected Infs / -Infs.
*   Added new Anomaly and Schema field for specifying ratio of supported images.
*   Added value_counts field to Feature message in schema.proto, which describes
    the number of values for features that have more than one nestedness level.
*   Added new anomaly type VALUE_NESTEDNESS_MISMATCH to describe data that has a
    nestedness level that does not match the schema.
*   Added new Any type value to CustomStatistic.

*   StructStatistics.common_statistics changed to StructStatistics.common_stats
    to agree with Facets.

## Breaking changes

*   The change from StructStatistics.common_statistics to
    StructStatistics.common_stats may break code that had this field set and was
    serializing to some text format. The wire format should be fine.
